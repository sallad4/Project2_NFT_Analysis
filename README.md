Analyzing Sentiment and Recent Sales Data to Understand the Most Promising NFT Projects

Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, are one of a kind digital property. While the art market has been on fire with many items selling for millions of dollars (US), the technology and role NFTs will play in culture is so new we are still trying, collectively, to understand their value and use cases. 

For investors, it would be useful to place a more (though never totally) objective framework around NFT art projects to discern where they should be focusing their attention and capital. Art is, of course, subjective and perhaps others will be willing to purchase a project simply because they enjoy the art's aestetics. However, for others, they want to purchase the NFT because they don't dislike the art, it is a well-known or popularly rising project, and they believe it will increase in value over a time frame.

Twitter seems to be as good of a source of mood as any regarding which projects are waning and waxing in popularity and potential. We built a sentiment analyzer of tweets containing the name of a list of top projects, according to the Rarity.tools website.
